# EventIC
EventIC (Event Information Center) is a web-design project created by Web-dev Crew
(a group of 6 first year students) from the department of Computer Science
of the faculty of Science of the University of Buea.

Aim:
This project is aimed at providing a website for EVENT REGISTRATION and ADVERTISSEMENT, 
particularly within the university campus, for both students and outsiders.

Problem and Problem Statement:
As years go by, spreading information accross the student body has been 
an issue due to the institution's growing population.
Despite the use of various social media fora, with level delegates coordinating, 
students still find it difficult to keep track of useful events happening on campus, 
largely because of disorderliness and mismanagement within the various social media fora, 
thus they tend to miss out on a lot of useful events and important informations.
"The students of the university of Buea miss out on important events and information
because of mismanagement within their various departmental social media fora."

Solution statement: "Web-dev Crew will provide an online platform (website)
that will help students register and get informed about upcoming events
happening on campus"

Features:
Main (Event registration, Event Creation, Study Ads)
